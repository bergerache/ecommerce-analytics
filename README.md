## 🧪 **Data Quality & Testing Framework**

**Enterprise-Grade Quality Assurance: 103/103 Tests Passing (100%)**

![Testing Results](images/testing-dashboard.png)

### **Test Coverage Strategy**
- **Source Tests** - Raw data validation and freshness monitoring
- **Model Tests** - Business logic validation and data integrity  
- **Cross-Model Tests** - Revenue reconciliation and customer consistency
- **Custom Business Tests** - RFM logic validation and data relationship checks

### **Key Quality Metrics**
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: All primary keys unique, foreign keys validated
- ✅ **Business Logic**: RFM segmentation mathematically sound  
- ✅ **Cross-Model Consistency**: Revenue totals reconciled across models
- ✅ **Data Freshness**: Automated monitoring for data pipeline health

```sql
-- Example Custom Business Test: Revenue Reconciliation
SELECT 
  'fct_sales' as source,
  SUM(line_total) as total_revenue
FROM {{ ref('fct_sales') }}
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'business_overview' as source,
  total_revenue
FROM {{ ref('business_overview') }}
-- Test fails if revenues don't match across models
```
